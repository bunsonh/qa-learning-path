### Why I've used ChatGPT  

In addition to drawing from my professional experience, I've employed ChatGPT and other LLMs to guide areas of this project. I've debated its value throughout which has lead to many questions and insights.

For starters, here are a few places where I've used these tools:
- Having never set up an environment for writing and submitting code, I consulted the LLM to give me an overview of best-practice in terms of toolsets and my current skill level. After offering several IDE options that included Atom and Sublime Text, I settled on VS Code due to its robust feature set and easy to navigate UI.
- While I knew I wanted to use GitHub for versioning, I was unsure how to implement this in Linux and integrate it with VS Code.
