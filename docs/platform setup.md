I realized I needed a way to track my progress, so I decided to start from absolute scratch by employing a "Beginner's Mind" approach.

**Some of the tasks I've completed:** 
- [x] configure fresh Ubuntu install within [Windows Hyper-V](//learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) VM client
- [x] created GitHub hub repository: [https://github.com/bunsonh](https://github.com/bunsonh)
- [x] set up `git` w/ SSH key
- [x] install and configure [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing and deploying to Github
- [x] install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator
- [x] install and configure [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/) Jekyll theme
- [x] learn Jekyll filesystem and markup; create [`Hello World`]({% link docs/hello-world.md %}) page

**ToDo:**
- [ ] create ideal dir/file structure and populate index.md
- [ ] deploy Jekyll site to GitHub pages
- [ ] create progress tracker for LinkedIn Learning courses
